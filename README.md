#Morsels
This repository contains random stuff that isn’t very useful, big, or not functional enough to have its own repository. Feel free to use these for whatever you want. There’s no license, but if you happen to use something from here, it’d be nice if you put a link back to [me](http://thrifus.co/) somewhere.

#Directory & File Map
* __C/HelloWorld.c__
	* My first program in C. Prints it in pretty colors, too.
* __Shell/AutoSSHLogin__
	* An Expect script to automatically log you in to a server of your choice. You’ll need to change some fields in the script if you plan on using it.
* __Web/BandwidthHelper.js__
	* A simple game and video blocker with JS. I originally started this when I got fed up with people ruining the bandwidth with their video watching and online game playing during school, prohibiting me from using [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) because of the terrible speed. I decided to write this and show it to someone after I had converted it into a Safari, Chrome, and Firefox extension, but I never really got around to it. This may be turned into an individual project eventually. Or maybe not. Who knows.
* __Xcode/Golden\ Platter/__
	* A rather annoying fork bomb written in Swift/AppleScript. Have fun.
