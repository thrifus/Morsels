#Morsels
This repository contains random stuff that isn’t useful or big/functional enough to have it’s own repository.

#Directory & File Map
* C/HelloWorld.c
	* My first program in C. Prints it in pretty colors, too.
* Shell/AutoSSHLogin
	* An Expect script to automatically log you in to a server of your choice. You’ll need to change some fields in the script if you plan on using it.
* Web/BandwidthHelper.js
	* A simple game and video blocker with JS. I originally started this when I got fed up with people ruining the bandwidth with their video watching and online game playing during school, prohibiting me from using [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) because of the terrible speed. I decided to write this and show it to someone after I had converted it into a Safari, Chrome, and Firefox extension, but I never really got around to it. This may be turned into an individual project eventually. Or maybe not. Who knows.
* Xcode/Golden\ Platter/
	* A rather annoying fork bomb written in Swift/AppleScript. Have fun.
